## Headphone Motion Module

Documentation: https://github.com/XHMM/react-native-headphone-motion

These are the steps I followed to create the module
```
npx expo prebuild --clean

npx create-react-native-library@latest ios-headphone-motion

yarn install

npx expo install expo-build-properties # to define the minimum development target for ios, it must be 15^


```

These are the commands to run the app
```
npx pod-install

yarn ios --device
```

I created a new command to achieve the same
```
yarn ios:pods
```
